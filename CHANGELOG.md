to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `security/tls-cert-expired` (error) and `security/tls-cert-expiring-soon` (warning) under
  `--check-network`: every HTTPS endpoint the file declares is presented with one short TLS
  handshake and its peer certificate's `valid_to` is read, so an already-expired certificate fails
  the run and one with fewer than 30 days left warns in time to renew it. Endpoints sharing a host
  are probed once, fixture-backed (`--mock-fixtures`) runs never open a socket, and an
  unobservable certificate is skipped rather than reported (#134).

- Follow and lint `toml` currency pointers. A `[[CURRENCIES]]` entry that points at a separate
  document via `toml` now has that document fetched and linted as part of the same run, so an
  anchor cannot pass with a broken linked asset. Enabled by `--follow-links` and implied by
  `--domain`. Findings from a linked document are prefixed with its URL, a pointer that cannot be
  fetched is a `network/toml-pointer-fetch` warning rather than a hard failure, and fetches are
  capped at 20 so a long currency list cannot fan out unboundedly.

- `--preset validator|anchor-sep24|issuer` applies a curated rule bundle for an organisation's role
  in the ecosystem, so a validator operator, a SEP-24 anchor, and a standalone asset issuer stop
  carrying the same `--off` chain through every workflow. `validator` keeps the validator and
  general file checks and silences the currency and anchor service rules (raising a duplicate
  validator `HOST` or `ALIAS` to `error`); `anchor-sep24` holds the SEP-24, SEP-10, and currency
  requirements at `error` and silences the validator rules; `issuer` holds currency, collateral,
  and documentation completeness at `error` and silences the anchor service rules. A preset is a
  baseline, so an explicit `--off`/`--warn`/`--error` still wins whatever order the flags appear in,
  and an unknown name lists the available presets and exits `2`. Bundles are assembled from the rule
  registry, so a rule registered later joins the group its category puts it in (#20).
- `general/deprecated-field` warns about legacy `AUTH_SERVER` and `DEPOSIT_SERVER` fields,
  unencrypted `FEDERATION_SERVER` values, and documentation keys placed outside `[DOCUMENTATION]`,
  with replacement syntax for SEP-10, SEP-12, SEP-6, and SEP-24 (#126).
- `--format markdown` emits a GitHub-flavored Markdown report built for a workflow's
  `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`: a pass/fail header with the error, warning, and info counts, a table with a
  row per finding, and collapsible `<details>` blocks carrying suggestions and spec links. `|`, `<`,
  and `>` are escaped so a hostile file cannot break the table or inject markup (#61).
- `--completion bash|zsh|fish` prints a native shell completion script covering every flag, the
  output formats, and the rule ids accepted by `--off`/`--warn`/`--error`. The rule ids come from
  the same registry the linter runs, so they never drift from the actual checks; an unsupported
  shell prints to stderr and exits `2` (#60).
- `network/sep6-missing-asset` (warning), alongside `network/sep6-info-error` and
  `network/sep6-info-malformed`, under `--domain` or `--check-network`: when `TRANSFER_SERVER` is
  declared, `GET <TRANSFER_SERVER>/info` is fetched with redirects followed and every non-native
  `[[CURRENCIES]]` asset must appear in the `deposit` or `withdraw` maps, keyed by bare code or
  `CODE:issuer` (#38).
- `soroban/invalid-auth-contract-interface` (error) under `--check-contracts`: for
  `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID`, the deployed WASM's `contractspecv0` custom section is parsed and the
  contract is required to export the SEP-45 `web_auth_verify` function. An unreadable interface
  stays silent rather than guessing (#37).

- `textDocument/hover` over LSP (#36): hovering a key or a table header in `stellar.toml` shows a
  Markdown tooltip with the qualified name (`[[CURRENCIES]].display_decimals`), the field's type
  (`integer (0-7)`), the SEP-1 description, the permitted values where the spec enumerates them
  (`live`, `dead`, `test`, `private`), and a link to the anchoring section of SEP-1. Documentation
  lives in `src/spec.ts` beside the `KNOWN_*` sets the linter checks against, with a test asserting
  the two never drift apart; whitespace, comments, and keys SEP-1 does not define show nothing.
- `network/wrong-path` (error) under `--domain`: when `/.well-known/stellar.toml` returns HTTP 404,
  the linter probes `https://<host>/stellar.toml` once. If the root path serves the file, the
  diagnostic says so and points at the SEP-1 location; if the root probe also fails, behaviour is
  unchanged (`network/unreachable` only). At most one extra request, still through the injected
  `fetchImpl` (#3).
- Interactive quick-fix code actions over LSP (#42): `stellar-toml-lint --lsp` runs a stdio Language
  Server that publishes diagnostics and answers `textDocument/codeAction` with `WorkspaceEdit`
  replacements for mechanically safe rules — `general/trailing-slash-in-endpoint`,
  `network/passphrase` (near miss), `documentation/social-handles`, `principals/social-handles`,
  and `documentation/phone-e164`. Diagnostics that cannot be corrected safely (parse errors,
  missing tables) offer no action. Shared fix engine lives in `src/fix.ts` for `--fix` (#9) to reuse.
- Glob patterns in the positional file arguments (`stellar-toml-lint "configs/**/*.toml"`), expanded
  by the linter rather than the shell so the same quoted argument works on Linux, macOS, and
  Windows, where PowerShell and CMD do not expand globs at all. `*`, `?`, `[...]`, and `**` are
  supported; a pattern that matches nothing reports itself and exits `2`; hidden entries are skipped
  unless named. Multi-file runs now close with a summary line — `Checked 4 files: 3 passed, 1 failed
(2 errors, 3 warnings)` — appended by the text reporter only, with the exit code still `1` if any
  file failed and `0` if they all passed (#18).

- Text output follows the [NO_COLOR standard](https://no-color.org) explicitly: any non-empty
  `NO_COLOR` disables colour, an empty value counts as unset, and only an explicit `--color`
  overrides it. Covered by `test/no-color.test.ts` (#148).

- `--format junit` emits a JUnit XML test report for CI dashboards that chart test results (Jenkins,
  Bamboo, CircleCI, Azure DevOps). Error-severity findings are reported as `<failure>` elements and
  warnings as `<error>` elements, so a dashboard counting failures matches the exit code (#143).

- `--format checkstyle` emits Checkstyle XML for CI dashboards that ingest the Checkstyle schema
  (Jenkins Warnings NG, Java-adjacent pipelines) (#8): one `<file>` per linted file, one `<error>`
  per diagnostic with `line`, `column`, `severity`, `message`, and `source` (the rule id).

- `validators/invalid-history-url` (error) validates each `[[VALIDATORS]].HISTORY` as a well-formed
  archive URL, including `{0}` template handling.
- `validators/stellar-history-json-unreachable` (error) under `--check-network` fetches each
  validator's archive root and requires it to serve `.well-known/stellar-history.json` with
  `"version": 1` (#144).
- Overlay and archive integrity audits: `--crawl-peers` decodes bounded `GET_PEERS` discovery
  responses, `--verify-dnssec` compares DNSSEC-validating DoH resolvers, and `--check-network`
  validates the three most recent history checkpoints for complete category archives and chained
  previous-ledger pointers (#90, #91, #92, #96).
- `overlay/invalid-crypto-framing` and `overlay/mac-authentication-failure` audit big-endian frame
  lengths, HKDF-derived session keys, sequence replay, and authenticated tags (#91).

- Opt-in `--check-network` flag to query Horizon and report non-existent `SIGNING_KEY` or `ACCOUNTS` entries as warnings (#7).
- `network/horizon-unreachable` and `network/horizon-protocol-outdated` under `--check-network`:
  the linter now GETs `HORIZON_URL` and asserts the response is a valid Horizon root document
  whose `current_protocol_version` is supported by the instance's `core_supported_protocol_version`,
  so a misconfigured, offline, or protocol-lagged Horizon endpoint fails the run instead of
  surfacing later as broken wallet interactions.
- `sep38/prices-endpoint-error`, `sep38/malformed-price-response`, `sep38/quote-endpoint-error`, and
  `sep38/malformed-quote-response` under `--check-network`: when `ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER` is declared,
  the linter GETs `/prices?sell_asset=...` for each classic currency and asserts a 200 whose body
  carries a `buy_assets` array of valid price objects, and probes `/quote` for 5xx or non-JSON 200
  answers — so a quote server returning 500s or malformed JSON fails the run instead of surfacing
  later as wallets unable to calculate transaction amounts.

### Fixed

- `--lsp` actually serves the protocol now. `main()` called the line-based `lspMain()`, which
  registered a stdin listener and then fell through to `process.exit`, so the process printed
  nothing and exited before a client could send a message. The CLI runs the framed stdio server
  (`src/lsp/server.ts`) instead — diagnostics, quick-fix code actions, and hover — and the
  unreachable server behind it is gone.

### Changed

- The `validators/history` warning is replaced by `validators/invalid-history-url`, which checks the
  same field more strictly and reports it as an error. Update any `--off validators/history`
  configuration to the new id.

### Added

- SEP-8 regulated issuer flags under `--check-network`: for every `[[CURRENCIES]]` entry marked
  `regulated=true` with a classic `issuer`, the linter reads the issuer account's flags from Horizon.
  A missing `AUTH_REQUIRED` flag emits `currencies/regulated-asset-missing-auth-required` (error), a
  missing `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag emits `currencies/regulated-missing-auth-revocable-flag` (warning),
  and a Horizon outage or missing account degrades to
  `currencies/regulated-issuer-flags-unverifiable` (warning) so the run still fails cleanly on
  strengthenable-to-fatal findings without depending on network availability. The audit lives in
  its own module, `src/rules/regulated-flags.ts`, so the network-bound currency checks stay
  separable from the offline ones (#136).
- Soroban contract liveliness under `--check-contracts`: `src/soroban.ts` queries the Soroban RPC's
  `getLedgerEntries` for the contract instance and its WASM behind every `[[CURRENCIES]].contract`
  and `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID`, comparing `liveUntilLedgerSeq` against `latestLedger`. Within ~a day of
  expiry it emits `soroban/contract-ttl-expiring-soon` (warning); expired or archived state emits
  `soroban/contract-expired` (error); an unreachable RPC degrades to `soroban/contract-ttl-unavailable`
  (warning). The endpoint is derived from `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` and overridable with `--soroban-rpc`.
- `security/deprecated-tls-version` and `security/weak-cipher-suite` warnings under `--domain`:
  the linter now inspects the TLS session the host negotiates and flags TLS 1.0/1.1 (and SSLv2/SSLv3),
  plus cipher suites built on 3DES, DES, RC4, CBC, NULL, or EXPORT primitives. Offline linting is
  unaffected, and both rules can be tuned with `--off`, `--warn`, and `--error` like any other.
- `lintDomain` accepts an optional `tlsProbe` so embedders and tests can supply the session instead of
  having one opened for them. `probeTls` is exported for callers that need to measure it themselves.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

### Added

- Offline SEP-1 validation of a local `stellar.toml`, with line and column for each finding.
- 47 registered rules across file, general, `[DOCUMENTATION]`, `[[PRINCIPALS]]`, `[[CURRENCIES]]`,
  and `[[VALIDATORS]]` categories, plus parse, encoding, and network checks emitted directly by the
  engine.
- Checksum-accurate Stellar key validation via `@stellar/stellar-base`, so a transposed character in
  an account or contract ID is caught rather than passed by a shape-only regex.
- Cross-field dependency checks: SEP-31 requiring SEP-12, SEP-10 requiring `SIGNING_KEY`, and SEP-45
  requiring both its endpoint and contract ID.
- `--domain` mode, fetching `https://<domain>/.well-known/stellar.toml` and additionally checking
  reachability, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, content type, and size.
- Reporters: human-readable text, JSON, SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub code scanning, and GitHub Actions
  workflow commands for inline PR annotations.
- Per-rule severity configuration via `--off`, `--warn`, and `--error`, plus `--strict` and
  `--max-warnings`.
- Programmatic API exporting `lint`, `lintDomain`, the reporters, and full TypeScript types.
- A composite GitHub Action.

### Notes

Two findings from testing against live anchors shaped the initial release:

- The CORS probe sends an `Origin` request header. Many hosts and CDNs only emit
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` when one is present, so probing without it reported a CORS failure
  against correctly-configured anchors.
- `code = "native"` is recognised as XLM, which has no issuing account and whose supply is a protocol
  property. The issuer and issuance-policy rules do not apply to it.
